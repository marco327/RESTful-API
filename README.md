RESTful API
===========

PHP RESTful API with an example MySQL database. Comes with various HTTP server response mechanisms, basic HTTP 
authentication, pagination and rate limits. Do note this API sends a delete request using the JSON body rather than using an ID within the URI.

Both Apache and IIS rewrite files are included.
